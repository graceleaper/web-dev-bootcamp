*** How Does the Internet Work? ***

- Internet: think of it as a long piece of wire, and the wire
connects different computers to each other

- Server: computer that is ready to serve all the files and data I'm requesting

- Client: my computer/device that is accessing the Internet

STEPS

1. Type in URL. My browser sends signal to my Internet Service Provider
(ISP) (AT&T, Spectrum, Verizon, etc.)

2. ISP will relay this URL / message to a DNS (Domain Name System) Server,
which is like a phonebook. It will look up in its database the exact IP address of the website I requested.
Every single computer connected to the internet has an IP address, which is like a postal address for a computer

3. After DNS Server finds IP address, it will be sent back to my browser

4. Client then sends a direct request to that IP address to the ISP


5. This direct requst will be delivered to the server with the IP address
I have via the internet backbone, which is a network of submarine cables. The server has all the files
I would need to view the website I requested

6. The server sends all the files back to me, via the backbone and ISP. And this all happens in just miliseconds!
