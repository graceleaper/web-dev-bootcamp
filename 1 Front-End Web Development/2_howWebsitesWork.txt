*** How Do Websites Work? ***

- What does HTML, CSS, and JavaScript do exactly?

- To access a webpage, we need a browser, like Chrome, Safari, Firefox, etc.
    - These browsers are all software that let us look up the IP address of our website we request,
    so we can receive data (or information) that will return us beautiful websites that we see
    - The data (or information) we receive from the server are usually made up of 3 types of files:
        - HTML, CSS, and JS
        - Why are there different files? Why can't we just have one file that will show us our website?
        - Each type of file has a designated/specific job

- Purpose of each type of code file:
    - HTML: the structure. If a website was a house, the HTML file would be the walls, toilets, etc. (any appliance or item of a house)
        - Use HTML to build structure of our website
        - Can use to add text, image, button, etc.
    - CSS: responsible for styling the website. If you're building a house, this would be the decorations and supplies used to style your home
        - Specify how we want our websites to be styled
        - We have a button, and we want to make it red
        - Make font on a webpage green with font type of Arial
        - All of this is done with CSS code
    - JS: adding functionality or behavior to our webpage
        - Like adding electricity and plumbing system to a home
        - JS code allows our websites to actually do things
        - If we have button on a website, we can use JS to make it show a pop-up message on the screen
        - our website won't just display images and text. Website will have behavior


- Can mess around with existing websites!
    - Right-click on text or image, and select "Inspect"
    - Will explore developer tools in more detail in the future
    - After clicking on "Inspect" for a specific element (or item), the entire code file for this page will appear
    - The highlighted portion of the code corresponds to the highlighted part of the actual webpage (above or to the side, depending on display of dev tools)
    - Double click on the highlighted code, and we can edit its content!
    - Can prank friends (who aren't tech-savvy or technilogically advanced) with a screenshot
    - Unfortunately, when you hit "refresh", all of your hard work is gone
        - When editing on your browser, you're just changing the local copy that was delivered to you from the server we requested from
        - Refreshing a webpage means we're making another request to the server, which will give us fresh copies of the HTML, CSS, and JS files
            - Thus, updating to the original content from the server
    - But don't worry! We'll be making our websites with content that we want in coming meetings
