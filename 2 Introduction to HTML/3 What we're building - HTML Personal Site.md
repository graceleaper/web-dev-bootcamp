# What we're building - HTML Personal Site

- We haven't covered CSS yet, but don't worry. We'll eventually get to creating stylish websites
- Do you know what Google looked like when it was first launched? How about YouTube?
- There's a great website that can show us that
- The Internet Archive Wayback Machine (web.archive.org)
- Just enter the URL of the website we're interested in
- See how a website looked like when it was first "crawled", or live on the internet
- We can click on that snapshot
- It's like we time travelled to when the website was first launched!
- Most of these early websites are mostly made up of just HTML
- These websites may look terrible, but some of the world's top computer science professors (www.cs.dartmouth.edu/~thc/) look similar to the websites from the past
- Also see www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/
- If it's good enough for these computer science titans, then creating one of our first websites out of only HTML is good enough for us for now
- Hope you're excited, since I'm super excited to see what you all will make!
