# Favicons

- Notice how our personal site's tab has a blank sheet of paper, but a site lie seanhalpin.io has a cute icon next to his name
- favicons stand for "favorite icons"
- favicon.cc
    - Can import an image
    - Will give you a preview of your favicon
    - Download the favicon
- In HTML file:
```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
<link rel="icon" href="favicon.ico">
```
- Now, the favicon shows up in our tab
- Notice Sean's website has blocks / sections. Will learn this in our next lesson
