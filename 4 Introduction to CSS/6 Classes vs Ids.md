# Classes vs Id's

## Id Selector
- The `id` selector is similar to the `class` selector, but there is a difference

- In HTML file:
```
<h1 id="heading">Hello world</h1>
```
- In CSS file:
```
/***** ID SELECTORS *****/
#heading {
    color: blue;
}
```
- To target the id with the value of 'heading', use the pound, or hash, symbol followed by the value we gave it in our HTML file
- Notice that if we had the following in the same CSS file...
```
h1 {
    color: red;
}
```
- ... the #heading overrides the h1 styling. *** Styles with class and id selectors overrride tag selectors

## Class Selector
- When should use you classes and when should you use id's?
- You can only have one instance of an id on a single HTML file
    - So on a single file, you can only have one "heading" id. But you can have different id's on an HTML page
- Notice that you'll probably only have one h1 on a page anyways
-  Use `class` to group to related elements that you wanted to have the same styling
    - Notice textbook pages or newspaper layouts that have the same styling for certain features
- *** Any HTML element can have more than one class, but only one id
```
    <img class="broccoli orange-frame" src="broccoli.png" alt="broccoli">
```
- If you want multiple classes for an element, you need the separate the classes with a single space
    - Can't do this with id's â€“ can't have more than one id at a time
- Will rarely use id's
```
    .broccoli {
        background-color: red;
    }

    .orange-frame {
        border-color: orange;
        border-width: 5px;
    }
```
- What if I have a bunch of div's or p tags, but I don't want all my div's or all my p tags to have the same background-color and color? Can use `class` selector to make only certain div's or certain p's have a specific style

- Notice on websites like medium.com and similar ones, there's a section about the writer of the article underneath the post. Also notice that the paragraph inside the author section is styled differently than the paragraphs from the article above. So we wouldn't want to just style `p` tags. Or else the styling would be the same on the article and author section paragraphs.

- In the above code sample, we can have the same `class` name for the `p` tag within the div, in this case:  `writer-bio`. This will make the style for the `writer-bio` paragraph be different than the style from the other paragraphs that were used to write the actual article posts
- Notice that even though the `p` tags may styled have specific styles, using the `class` selector will override the styles for the `p` tag. So if we want to stay organized, we can apply classes to our article paragraph(???)
- Note: We can use class on any opening HTML tag. If we really wanted to, we can do the following:

```
<p>Welcome to <em class="location">The Buckley School</em></p>
```
- And we can use `color`, `font-size`, etc. on the `location` class
