# Intro to JS

- JavaScript: the language that powers the web
- Brendan Eich created the JavaScript language in just 10 days
- We can't even imagine a world without JavaScript
- Go to your browser
    - Let's try to turn off JavaScript in our Chrome browser, and see what happens to the website
    - Go to settings, and search for "javascript"
    - Navigate to "JavaScript", and switch off "Allow" to "Blocked"
    - Go to The New York Times, and you'll see that the ads won't load because we disabled JavaScript. So some people will turn off JavaScript for this reason
    - Sites like YouTube and Netflix won't even load though (without JavaScript)
    - The world is actually a scary place without JavaScript
    - There were multiple names for JavaScript at the time when it came out
        - LiveScript, JScript, etc.
        - Europeans do what they do best: decided to standardize the language
        - They decided to call JavaScript and all these other names just "ECMAScript"
            - European Computer Manufacturers Association Script
            - You'll notice that there are different versions of JavaScript, but you won't see JS5 or JS6. Instead, you'll see ES5 or ES6
- Why is it called JavaScript?
    - "script" comes from play scripts

- In JavaScript, we can think of HTML elements as actors
- JavaScript is the one language that is supported by all major browsers

- What language should you learn first or learn later on?
- If you want to build:
    - website for the browser: JavaScript
    - iPhone apps: Swift
    - Android apps: Java
