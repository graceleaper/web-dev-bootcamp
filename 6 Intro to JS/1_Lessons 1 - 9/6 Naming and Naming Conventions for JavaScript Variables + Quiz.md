# Naming and Naming Conventions for JavaScript Variables + Quiz

- So far, we've been using variable names like "yourName" or "myName". But it doesn't matter what we call our names
- We can use "bananas" or "oogabooga"
- But give meaningful names to your variables
- It's like giving our boxes with labels that actually say what the boxes contain

## Restrictions when naming variables
- Can't start with a number. So can't have something like:
```
let 5dogs = 5;
```
- We will get an error from the above code
- But our variable name can still contain numbers:
```
let my123 = 123;
```
- Can't have spaces in variable names

## What's allowed
- Can only have numbers, letters, underscores, and dollar symbols (although rare)
- Usually, after the first letter, capitalize the first letter of other words in the variable
    - This is called camel-casing:
    ```
    let myName = "Grace";
    ```
